**ubuif** was born out of the need for a framework, a framework that could do anything, be anything and at the same time be friendly to the developers and business.

It is a **full MVC** framework and can be used for websites, CMS', command line, **it is still in development** and I try to update it at least once a day but since I only get 2 hours a day to work on it around the rest of my life progress might not be as fast as people want it.

The structure of the framework is loosely based on the Zend Framework, I think its best for developers to stick to something they already know (and if they don't know it, its a good way to expand their knowledge of the structure of a full MVC framework)

I plan to have the firs version completed by the end of this year (2012) and released very early 2013 and I will be looking for developers to add to it, to give me constructive criticism and to help build upon the framework. All contributors will be credited and noted on both the wiki and the website.

I will write full documentation on it one I have a more stable version ready.
